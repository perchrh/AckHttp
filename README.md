# AckHttp

Simplifies HTTP request in Swift.

AckHttp simple wrapper around the Swift APIs on iOS to simplify making synchronous and asyncronous HTTP request.

Based on a blog post from Nick O'Neill, 
https://thatthinginswift.com/write-your-own-api-clients-swift/

The name is an homage to OkHttp, the HTTP client by Square. Ack comes from the TCP protocol, and is the positive response to the creation of a connection.
